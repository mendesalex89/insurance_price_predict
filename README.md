Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict insurance charges based on factors like age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The dataset used is the insurance.csv dataset.

Machine Learning Paradigms
Machine learning paradigms include:

Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data. Examples include linear regression, decision trees, and classification algorithms.
Unsupervised Learning: The model finds patterns and relationships in unlabeled data. Examples include clustering algorithms like K-Means.
Semi-Supervised Learning: Combines labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy.
Chosen Algorithm
Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the single output variable.

How the Algorithm Works
In Linear Regression, the algorithm fits a linear equation to the observed data. The linear equation is of the form:
𝑌

Real-World Application
A real-world application of Linear Regression is predicting the insurance charges for individuals based on their personal characteristics. This can help insurance companies set fair prices for their clients.

Application Overview
The application built with Streamlit allows users to:

Explore the dataset through visualizations.
Train machine learning models (Linear Regression and Random Forest).
Evaluate model performance.
Predict insurance charges based on user input.
Installation
To run the Streamlit application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

sh
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/alexmendes/insurance_price_predict.git
cd insurance_price_predict
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

sh
Copiar código
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

sh
Copiar código
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit application:

sh
Copiar código
streamlit run app.py
Usage
Upon running the Streamlit application, you will see the main interface with options to explore the data, train models, evaluate them, and make predictions. Follow the instructions on the interface to interact with the application.
